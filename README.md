Myanmar Unicode Testing in Ruby 1.9.3 and 2.0 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yelinaung/UnicodeInRuby.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yelinaung/UnicodeInRuby)
============================================

The main purpose is to make the code as burmese as possible and
beautiful. To be able to replace the Keyword such as require, if , else, def, end
we will need to re-compile Ruby interpreter.

Thanks to this amazing [maginc_encoding](https://github.com/m-ryan/magic_encoding) gem, it's working perfectly with `ruby-1.9.3-p362` .

It works nicely for `ruby-2.0.0-p0 [ x86_64 ]` too.

For Ubuntu/ OS X, you can just run
`ruby unicode.rb`
